Analytics I: Predictive Models
This project explores predictive modeling techniques applied to real-world datasets as part of the Analytics I coursework. The goal was to build and evaluate multiple models to make accurate predictions and gain insights using statistical and machine learning methods.

Project Objectives
Understand the process of predictive analytics from data preprocessing to model evaluation
Apply different classification algorithms to solve a binary classification problem
Interpret model outputs and assess performance using key metrics

Methods Used
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Logistic Regression
Naive Bayes Classification
Random Forest
Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision/Recall)

Language: R

Libraries: tidyverse, caret, e1071, randomForest

Environment: RStudio

Outcome
Through this project, we compared the effectiveness of various models and interpreted the factors influencing the predictions. The assignment helped build a strong foundation in supervised learning techniques and performance evaluation for predictive tasks.
